# Spectrum Hawk 🦅

**Advanced WiFi Network & Device Enumeration Tool**

Spectrum Hawk is a powerful Python-based wireless network scanner designed for security professionals, network administrators, and ethical hackers. It identifies WiFi networks, enumerates connected devices, and provides detailed device fingerprinting—perfect for locating specific IoT/CCTV cameras and understanding network topology.

## Use Cases
  - **Security Auditing** – Identify all devices on a network
  - **IoT Device Discovery** – Find CCTV cameras, smart devices
  - **Network Mapping** – Understand network topology
  - **Targeted Attacks** – Focus on specific networks/devices instead of wasting time by attacking all networks
## 📋 Requirements
  - **Wi-Fi Adapter** - Use Wi-Fi adapter for scanning long range and better results
